# 0x03. Queuing System in JavaScript

## Project Overview
The "0x03. Queuing System in JavaScript" project focuses on implementing a queuing system using JavaScript. It leverages Redis for data storage and Kue for job queue management. The goal is to understand and work with asynchronous task handling, job processing, and optimization in backend systems using modern JavaScript and Node.js technologies.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Modern JavaScript syntax for backend development.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for creating APIs and handling HTTP requests.
- **Redis**: In-memory data structure store used for caching and queuing.
- **Kue**: A priority job queue backed by Redis.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:
- Understand the concept and importance of job queues in backend systems.
- Learn how to use Kue and Redis for job queue management.
- Handle asynchronous task execution and error handling.
- Optimize the performance of backend systems by offloading intensive tasks to queues.
- Implement a queue-based notification system using Express.js.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Node.js and Redis installed on your machine.
- Familiarity with JavaScript and Express.js is recommended.
